[Team CJPythons](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/images/librariesprovider118/news-events/scse-computing-challenge-202154f84e0e-2c74-4211-a795-816575dbf69f.jpg?Status=Master&sfvrsn=464ed816_3)
Awarded: Young Technopreneurs Award

## CNN and RNN
Our solution used [CNN and RNN](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/cnn-vs-rnn/) as our deep learning algorithm.

- CNN: used for image processing, recognition and classification.
- RNN: make better predictions by remembering vital details(eg: input received)

## MNIST Datasets from Keras
We incorporated additional datasets of handwritten digits: MNIST, [learn more about MNIST Datasets in Python](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/mnist-dataset-in-python)

## CTC Operation
To solve errors on duplicated characters. We need to calculate the loss value for the training samples to train the NN.
